            <p> We are so happy you've found us! We are Jake and Brittney Child, owners and operators of BJC Carpentry. We met early on in our youth, and reconnected as adults in our local church.
                We were married in 2010 and now have four beautiful children who keep us busy, active, and creative.  Many of our projects stem from ideas for or from 
                our children. Jake is the primary carpenter, who has spent countless hours teaching and training Brittney, who just loves to learn knew things and find 
                new pathways to create.  From handmade, to CNC made, we love to do it all.
            
                We also love to work with Jake's dad and brother, Brian and Caleb, who, oddly enough, fit right into the BJC Carpentry name!  They're knowledge and creativity
                is unparalleled.  You'll often find the three boys discussing projects, tools, or new ideas they'd like to experiment with. We are truly a family operation, and our
                goal is to always bring you handmade, quality furniture and wood crafting supplies that will last a lifetime. </p>
