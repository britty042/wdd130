      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        [The home page of our website should be inviting, and we'd love to have two pictures that invite you into the shop space 
        as well as the blog space. It will include our vision statement explaining why we do what we do, what we try to do, and how
        we accomplish those things. It would say something similar to this:  They would also come to our site over another because of the 
        quality of our product.  My husband is a perfectionist, and I love design.  Together, we feel we make a great team in the 
        creation of fine furniture, décor and wood crafting.  Our products are durable, quality, and worth more than our prices show.  
        They will last a long time, and have simple additions for functionality and purpose that comes through really thinking through 
        each project.  We also love to design for fun!  Especially for kids. We hope that our creativity and love of woodwork shows through 
        the designs and creations we make.  Wood-plank image from Freepik]

      </ul>
      <h3>[Shop]</h3>
      <p>
        [This section will include shopping/ordering of furniture, décor, woodworking plans, and unfinished products for wood crafting.
        People will come to my website primarily to shop for furniture, décor or wood crafting products including completed and ready for 
        display furniture and decor, woodworking plans for build your own projects, as well as unfinished products for crafting, so we would 
        definitely need a “shop” section.  The primarily question meets the primary purpose, how much do the products cost? Additional questions 
        may include how much shipping costs would be, if we offer local pick-up, and if we offer the opportunity to specify finishes and paint 
        colors. Visitors will primarily want to shop on our website.  Once the blog is up and running, they will also like to read more about tools, 
        projects, finishing instructions or helpful tips in woodworking. As some of our products will offer customization as to finishes and paint 
        colors, our visitors will also participate, as part of the ordering process, the opportunity to select or “try on” various paint colors and 
        finishing styles (ie. Stains, flat, semi-gloss, or glossy finishes, etc.) Our standard plans will have set prices and ordering will be through 
        the “shop” section of the website, but special orders may be received upon request. I will definitely need pricing information for the products 
        that we will sell.  This information can be gathered based on current pricing of supplies (wood, nails/screws, paint and finishes, etc.), as well 
        as the guesstimated amount of time each piece would take to complete. Most of this information would be readily available at my local wood supply 
        store, or available using their online website as well.  I would also need a little information as to what is “trending” right now in the wood 
        crafting/fine furniture sector.  I can gather this information via other websites, and simply by watching and reviewing the designs sold at furniture 
        stores near me and around my area.  In doing so, I would ensure that items we make would actually sell. We would also need basic plans for woodworking 
        projects, which would need to be developed over time.

      <h3>[Blog]</h3>
      <p>
        [The blog/vlog section will discuss woodworking tips, as well as instructions for completing unfinished wood crafting projects.
        It would also be fun to have a “blog” section that includes helpful woodworking tips, as well as instructions for finishing 
        crafting projects as they were designed.  We could include some instructional videos for those just starting out, as well as 
        potentially include product reviews. We would also answer questions as to how to complete the unfinished projects we sell on 
        our site and provide additional helps and ideas for beginner projects. I would also need content and information for the blog 
        section of the website, which would require putting in the effort to write, or make a video, in regards to the projects we are 
        currently working on. This information would primarily come from us without a lot of research.
