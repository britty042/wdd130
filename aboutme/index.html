    <h2>Brittney Child</h2>
    <p>HI!  My name is Brittney and I am from Northern Utah. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Nursing, but recently felt prompted to return and receive more education.  So here I am!</p>
    <p>I am a mother to 4 awesome kiddos, and a wife to one incredible man! I love anything outside, especially in my garden, and I enjoy memory keeping and woodworking.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints all of my life, but consider myself a daily convert. I feel like everyday is a change to recommit to be a little better. I love to learn, and Jesus is a master teacher.</p>
    <p>I've chosen to study web and graphic design, because I love to create and because it's challenging for me. I hope to apply my skills to support my family remotely, and what better way than in computers!</p>
